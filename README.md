Description :

This is a free script which we are releasing this is a very basic and useful script for admins and normal players for usual rp the admins will be adble to give vehicle to anyone in the server with a custom number plate in the server, whereas for civilians they will be bale to transfer vehicles to anyone in the city! ; else preview is uploaded below!

Features :
- A single command to give a car to anyone in the server /givecar [id] [vehiclename] [licenseplate]    *Only admins! Note: If plate is none will randomly generate a new plate
- The license plate will be saved in the database which will be a huge relief as it wont be a error or disappearing or changing of license plates
- The vehicles will be differentiated on the basis of there license plates means the best part is they cant spawn two vehicles on the same license plate
- We have also added a brand new feature of transfer vehicle which is the best as you guys can transfer the vehicle within the server with a solo command 
- This will also be differentiated according to the license plates which means there will be no mismatch in transferring vehicles to the other !
- So we   have added a command /transfercar [id] you will be supposed to be sitting in the vehicle to do this so that there will be no mismatch and the guy will 
  receive the vehicle! (As some vehicles dont have visible number plates!)
- As this is a release you guys have any questions and have some good changes feel free to put some pull requests on github
